      <h2>Welcome!  Thanks for interviewing with Hinge Health!</h2>
      <p>We're going to work with some trees today.  Our goal with this exercise isn't to 
      "stump" anyone with tricky business, but to give candidates a fair and uniform way to 
      express themselves in code on a realistic-ish problem.</p>  
      <p>
      In an hour, we expect everyone will get some of the way through this problem, and 
      no one will get all the way through.  If invited to an on-site interview, you'll 
      pair with us wherever you left off, because we'd much rather see how you work on a problem you're familiar with and have had time 
      to think about than on some clever whiteboard puzzle we spring on you.
      </p>
      <p>
      At this stage, we care most about:
      <ul>
        <li>Interpreting written specs (following instructions)</li>
        <li>General familiarity with layout, data modeling, interaction, network i/o</li>
        <li>Legible code</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        When in doubt, do less, better. :)
      </p>

                <li>Check out the file <code>./tree/index.js</code>.</li>
